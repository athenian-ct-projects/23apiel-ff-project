Rules for Jeapardy on Harry Potter Day:
  * I will create a Jeopardy poster with 5 catagroies for with points ranging from 100 to 500
  * There will be two teams competing against eachother
  * The players will pick a category with a the amount of points they want and a question will be asked about the topic they       picked (as the amount of points you can get increases the question will get harder) 
  * If you get a question right you get then you get the amount of points you picked (The computer will keep track of the         amount of points you recieve)
  * Each question must be answered with " What is " and it has to be spelled correctly otherwise you will not get credit with     a question mark at the end
  * The objective of the game is to clear the board and get the most point out of all the other teams
