Add info about game here: I have created a Jeopardy game for Harry Potter Day this will test how well you know the Harry Potter universe:
1.	Split the group into 2 teams.
2.	Have one group answer the 1st question, “Are you group 1 or 2?”
3.	Then you will be asked to select a category you have 3 options: Hogwarts, Geography, and Random Facts
4.	After you will be asked to select an amount of points: 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500.
5.	Then answer the question that corresponds to the number you picked.
6.	Then right down the number of points you receive from answering the question.
7.	Repeat the last 3 steps for group two, then repeat the last 3 steps for group 1, and ect.  
8.	Once you have answered a question both teams can’t answer the question again. 
9.	At the end of the game add up your score to determine the winner.
*you must also use correct spelling and capitalization for the code to work
